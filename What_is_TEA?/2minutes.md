TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts Rich yet Decentralized applications. For short, "Rich dApps." Unlike typical centralized apps, Rich dApps are decentralized. They are purely serverless and running on miner's nodes like blockchain. Unlike blockchain dApps, smart contracts, Rich dApps run like centralized cloud-based apps, with similar high scalability and user experiences. TEA Project combines good parts from both blockchain and cloud computing.

TEA Project has two layers. But unlike most layer-2 solutions that are trying to improve consensus algorithm. Instead, TEA is not to improve but only uses blockchain on what it is good at and supposed to. In the TEA project, dApps code runs on layer-2, Web Assembly runtime inside hardware protected enclaves. Those hardware enclaves generate PoT (Proof of Trust) data handled by the blockchain consensus on layer-1. Therefore, in TEA, blockchain doesn't use consensus to verify the result of dApps code but the execution environment where the code runs.

So here is the basic assumption: if the execution environment is trusted, the code and input data are trusted, then the execution result can be trusted. 

TEA Project is based on IPFS, Blockchain, Web Assembly, and Trusted Computing technologies. By adding a TEA hardware security module, the IPFS node can also serve as a computing node besides serving static content. IPFS turns to Inter Planetary Function-as-a-Service. 

TEA project has two tokens. The TEA token is a stable utility token as gas. The Camellia token is an NFT that presents the credit and capability of a TEA mining node. TEA token economy is an autonomous evolution ecosystem.
