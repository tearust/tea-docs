# The TEA Token Economy
A healthy token economy is essential to incentivize behavior that helps support the TEA ecosystem. To this end, we've designed three main types of tokens to help the TEA Project achieve its goals:

1. The **TEA** utility token.
2. The **CML** NFT that comes with mining privileges.
3. Bonding curve tokens

## 1. The TEA Utility Token
Our first token, TEA, is a utility token with a supply of 100 million tokens pre-allocated in the genesis block. TEA is also given as a reward to miners for running public services (e.g. remote attestation) on the TEA network. Note that there's no inflation: the 100 million TEA tokens is a hard cap with mining rewards generated through a taxation process on state maintainer nodes. 

TEA has a variety of uses on the platform:

-   TEA pays for gas when performing any transaction on the network which is paid out to miners.
-   TEA is paid by consumers when using a TApp.
-   TEA can be used to purchase tokens issued on a bonding curve representing different entities in the TEA ecosystem (explained below). 

The 100 million tokens minted at genesis will be allocated with different vesting schedules (18 months for the investment rounds, 22 months for the community and team). The allocation is as follows:

## TEA’s Value in Terms of Computing Cost
TEA’s first use is as a utility token, used to pay gas on the network. One feature of the TEA token is that it represents cost certainty regarding the amount of computing resources used. Stated differently, the unit cost of computing resources (such as cpu utilization, ram, network traffic, and storage) should be relatively stable when measured in terms of TEA tokens:

**CPU** (compute_time * cpu_rate_price)
 
**Traffic** (net_traffic_bandwidth * traffic_rate_price)
+
**Storage** (storage_size * storage_time * storage_rate_price)
=
Task price in $T.

## 2. The CML NFT with Mining Privileges
Camellia (CML) is a non-fungible token (NFT) that's used by TEA miners to activate their mining machines. The CML tokens essentially act as both an ID mechanism for their mining nodes as well as an access key that allows them to mine on the TEA network. To run a node on the TEA platform, miners must associate a special NFT with their machine that acts as a mining license. The CML that is associated with a mining machine tracks that machine's features (e.g. ram and presence of graphics card) as well as behavior (e.g. uptime). This information on each CML ID is stored in the ERC-721 token’s metadata. In a scenario where the miner wishes to upgrade their hardware, moving the CML to their new machine also transfers its metadata such as its trust score. 

There are two different types of mining privileges on the TEA Project platform:

1. A hosting node which is activated by a CML (Camellia) NFT. This allows a miner to host TApps on the platform.
2. A state maintainer seat license that allows a user to run a state machine node.

Let's take a look at each of these in turn.

## 2.1 CML NFTs
A CML is an NFT with a life cycle determined randomly via algorithm. CML, also known as Camellia, has some unique properties and uses on the TEA Project platform.

- A TEA mining node can only be activated by associating a CML NFT with it.
Each CML has a lifespan associated with it (approximately 2 years). Like its Camellia name suggests, every CML has a life span that mimics organic plants - it grows from a seed, matures into a fully productive tree, and eventually dies. 
Each mining machine's characteristics (its hardware capabilities) will be recorded within the CML NFT.
- Investors can buy shares in a mining nodes to earn a percentage of that node's mining rewards. This is done through a CML token which will be described below.
- Miners buy new Camellia seeds through open bidding. The DAO issues new CML NFTs in accordance to how much demand for hosting there is in the TEA ecosystem.
- CML mining nodes earn TEA from the gas paid by end-users to use their hosting nodes to run TApps. 
CML nodes can also earn remote attestation rewards in TEA as compensation for performing this public service. These rewards are paid out from the state maintainer seats paying their Harberger Tax. If during any period there's not enough from these Harberger Taxes to pay the remote attestation rewards, then a reserve fund will be tapped. The reserve fund is part of the treasury and will eventually go away after the ecosystem has had enough time to mature.
Any Harberger Taxes in excess of the remote attestation rewards due the miners are also paid out to the CML node operators.

## 2.2 State Maintainer Seats
A state maintainer seat license allows a node operator to function as a state machine node. Because of the importance of the state machine, the TEA Project team and select invitees will only be allowed to run state machine nodes for approximately the first 2 years after mainnet launches. The supply of these seat licenses will be determined by a DAO vote and they have a complex token economy described as follows:

- TApps will pay state maintainer nodes as part of using the state machine. This is known as the **Memory Tax**.
- The Memory Tax is the sole source of income for state maintainer nodes and is shared among all node operators.
- Every state maintainer will pay a state maintainer tax known as a **Harberger Tax**. The TEA Project has elected to adopt a Harberger Tax given that state maintainer licenses are a public good.
- The Harberger Tax paid by each state maintainer is a set percentage (voted on by the DAO) of the seat's self-valuated price. Each seat owner can set their own price for what they think their state maintainer license is worth. Anyone in the community can purchase any of these seats by bidding 1T higher than the self-valuation price.
- Harberger Taxes go to pay remote attestation rewards earned by CML node operators. Any excess funds are also distributed to the CML node operators as a surplus reward for their mining services.

## 3. Bonding Curve Tokens

The TEA Project uses bonding curves throughout its tokenomics design for the following types of token entities:

1. TApp tokens
2. CML hosting node tokens

Before further explaining each type of token, let's look at some traits of bonding curves. 

The project's bonding curve provides on-chain liquidity to enter and exit positions, providing security for investors. In the bonding curve below, the price increases as more tokens are bought. Investors buy at the red line and sell at the blue line where there will always be liquidity at each level along the bonding curve.

<img width="815" alt="5 TEA-Project-Bonding-Curve" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86096370/188735110-b522f614-5eda-4b08-b62d-901ec13b70c2.png">

When using TEA to purchase bonding curve tokens, it's most advantageous to be among the early investors. Early adopters are rewarded for their investment as their token price increases when more people buy the entity's token on its bonding curve. And conversely as people sell into the bonding curve, the sold tokens are destroyed (decreasing the supply) while releasing the TEA locked in the bonding curve back to the investor.

### 3.1 TApp Tokens

Each TApp has an associated token issued on a bonding curve. A developer looking to launch a dApp on the TEA network could hold a bonding curve sale to generate early liquidity. Investors could use their TEA tokens to buy the TApp tokens of projects they believe will be more valuable in the future.

When a consumer pays TEA to use a TApp, this is known as a **consume action** where the following chain reaction occurs:

1. A percentage of the payment known as **theta** is channeled directly to the TApp developers. This is used by the developers to fund development (i.e. pay salaries) as well as pay for the cost of running the TApp (paying CML host miners and purchasing state memory tokens).
2. The rest of the payment is used to buy the TApp's tokens on its bonding curve.
3. The new TApp tokens generated by this transaction are distributed proportionally to the existing TApp token holders.

The gains from consume action are therefore shared by the app developers, the hosting miners, and the investors. 

### 3.2 CML Tokens
Each Camellia has a bonding curve token associated with it that investors can purchase. The purchasers of any CML's token will have a claim on a percentage of what that mining machine earns as mining revenue. This allows non-technical users (or uses who don't have the space or bandwidth to run a mining machine) to earn TEA revenue by participating in mining without having to setup and administer a mining machine.

The timing of when these bonding curve tokens are purchased matters when it comes time to distribute the mining revenue. The earlier the purchase time, the cheaper the price of the bonding curve tokens. And the earlier the purchase time, the more chances the token holder will have to earn dividend payouts according to the amount of tokens they hold. Dividends are paid out in the camellia's bonding curve token. Because it's a bonding curve, token holders can cash out to TEA at any time at the price determined by the bonding curve.
