## Executive Summary
The TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications that run completely serverless inside of contributor's compute nodes. The TEA Project builds upon web3 technologies like blockchain as well as trusted hardware to unlock a decentralized compute layer that runs on par with traditional cloud apps. TEA leverages hardware security modules (HSM) within decentralized compute nodes to ensure a secure app execution environment. The TEA network compute layer runs fast and decentralized using time as a root of trust to order transactions. 

The TEA Project aims to become an ideal entry point for developers looking to migrate from web2 to web3. We don't require devs to learn a new programming language or adapt to blockchain concepts within their workflow. Developers can deploy TEA Project apps (known as TApps) using programming languages and methodologies they're already familiar with. Our platform includes the same three-tier architecture that's prevalent in web2: a front-end, a back-end, and a database. And developers can use any number of popular programming languages as our output format (WebAssembly) has wide compatibility.

We believe that the initial blockchain-based forays into decentralized compute has revealed the limitations of smart contract-based decentralized networks. TEA has used elements of blockchain along with other roots of trust to make an evolutionary leap bringing decentralization into the realm of full-speed computing. By using non-traditional consensus, the TEA Project is able to create a decentralized app platform that's unstoppable, censorship-free, and that must respect user privacy.

## The Problem
Blockchains are an incredible invention that brought the benefits of decentralization to a wider audience. Layer-1 blockchains run dApps written as smart contracts and have gained a strong toehold in niches like DeFi. Blockchains like Ethereum provide a world computer where smart contracts can run in a decentralized manner. They are further augmented by web3 innovations like IPFS, a peer-2-peer file system that stores files decentralized. But smart contracts by themselves cannot currently run complex algorithms. Attempts to do so have shown smart contracts to be too slow or too expensive as they lack the processing power compared to modern cloud computers.

Valuing decentralization has up to now meant dealing with the limitations of consensus and the limited computing capabilities of smart contracts. Developers wishing to deploy to web3 currently have to deal with the limitations of technologies like blockchain and IPFS. For decentralization to gain a larger marketshare among app developers, dApps will need to approach the speed and complexity of web2 cloud-based apps. 

A logical question is whether smart contract-based decentralized systems can ever begin to compete with general computing for marketshare? Smart contract-based blockchains like Ethereum have always been affected by scalability issues. Ethereum and other chains have dealt with this issue by either:

- Attempting to increase scalability by tweaking the consensus mechanism.
- Utilizing a layer-2 to clear transactions off-chain.

But tweaking the consensus mechanism can only go so far when lots of time is wasted waiting on consensus being reached among peer nodes. The fundamental problem is that the decentralized nodes don't trust each other and have to find clever ways to work around that limitation.

Although layer-2s can speed up transaction throughput, these introduce an extra verification step that's computationally expensive. The increased reliance on layer-2s to boost TPS still can't overcome one of the fundamental limitations of blockchain, namely that the code and consensus run on the same layer.

And even after scalability tweaks, these chains still have the limitations inherent with smart contracts. For decentralized compute to capture web2 market share, we need a new infrastructure that goes beyond the ledger-bound smart contract.

## The Solution
The TEA Project moves decentralized computing from its current focus (on blockchain and smart contract) and into full-speed app execution. Smart contracts run like stored procedures of a simple database whereas the TEA Project unlocks a decentralized front-end and back-end server tiers in addition to a decentralized database. The TEA Project builds upon blockchain by incorporating it as one of its roots of trust but combines them with two other roots of trust to unlock full-speed decentralized computing.

One of the enduring problems of decentralized systems is how to circumvent the slow processing speeds inherent with consensus. The TEA Project avoids slower forms of consensus through the use of three roots of trust: blockchain, trusted hardware, and time. These three roots of trust are used to create two separate consensus algorithms:

- **Proof of Trust**: A central TEA principle is that if the execution environment can be trusted, then the execution result can be trusted as well. The consensus mechanism of other protocols are generally concerned with the execution result and not the integrity of the compute environments. TEA’s compute layer consensus verifies the integrity of its compute nodes using the trust data from the onboard hardware security modules (HSM), with the resulting status written to the Ethereum blockchain. 
- **Proof of Time**: The consensus mechanism for a decentralized state machine is ultimately trying to get its participants to agree on the same sequence of transactions. To this end, the TEA Project’s state machine runs a separate consensus based on time. Specifically, TEA uses the timestamps as reported by the compute nodes’ atomic clocks (or GPS) units to order transactions coming to its state machine. Since time is trustable in our universe, TEA uses it as the basis of transaction ordering in its state machine.

The TEA Project has solved the TPS issues inherent in ledger-based blockchains by moving to a new form of consensus that’s based on atomic clocks. We don’t need to solve complex math problems because we’re not requiring nodes to calculate a consensus. The TEA Project is using atomic clocks and GPS satellites in combination with hardware security modules to reach a non-traditional consensus.

It could be said that these two new consensus mechanisms, Proof of Trust and Proof of Time, are the TEA Project's main innovations that unlock a full-speed decentralized web for apps that require data security and censorship-resistance. By combining blockchain with IPFS, GPS and trusted hardware, the TEA Project can meet the needs of large-scale, high-frequency apps while ensuring permission-less decentralization and data privacy protection.

## Introducing the TEA Project

The TEA Project presents a decentralized compute infrastructure that respects private user data while allowing apps to run both decentralized and on par with cloud-hosted apps. The TEA Project offers a compute layer that sits adjacent to blockchain while offering the same level of decentralization and trust. We're a fully decentralized compute layer without the limitations of smart contracts.

The TEA Project creates a decentralized compute network capable of running full speed apps by combining three roots of trust:

1. **Blockchain** (Ethereum) is used to store the remote attestation results of TEA’s compute nodes and to enforce economic incentives for node runners (miners).
2. TEA uses the **hardware security modules** (such as TPM chips) aboard the compute nodes to run compute tasks privately. A natural byproduct of this architecture is that user data remains private and isn’t leaked outside the enclave.
3. **Atomic clocks** form the basis of TEA's Proof of Time consensus which reliably orders transactions from the decentralized nodes. This forms the basis of the state machine that maintains the present status of all the apps running on TEA’s compute layer.

### How TEA Project Solves a Big Web2 Problem
The web2 world of cloud-hosted apps has created an emerging need for apps that truly protect **private user data**. End-users want to use apps without giving companies access to their private data without their consent. The TEA Project is able to meet this emerging privacy demand as data running inside of TApps remains within each node's enclave. The trustability of each compute node is vouchsafed by the platform itself. The technologies built into the TEA platform protects the data as well as the integrity of the result. Under the watchful eye of hardwar security modules, the decentralized app’s computation is based on the expected code and the expected data. No one can alter the input code, the input data, or the output result. If any of the nodes have been tampered with or hacked, the TPM will report it. We verify the result by verifying the execution environment: if the execution environment is trustable, then we can trust the result of an app running in that trusted environment. The result of the computation is correct given the computing environment is verified through proof of trust data that is shared in the network and verified via remote attestation. 

One of the major benefits of using apps deployed on the TEA Project is that computing only happens within the protected enclaves of the decentralized TEA Project nodes. This means that the node hosting the app code and private user data has no access while the app executes with the user-provided data. After the app execution is completed, the contents of the enclave is destroyed. The end-user gets the result from the app and there are no traces of their private data left anywhere on our network. There's no chance of data breaches during the entire process.

Giving user's back the privacy of their own data also implies they can monetize it as they wish. In web2, users have little to no say in how companies monetize their private data. In TEA's version of web3, each user can choose to keep their data private or offer it to companies who pay for the privilege of using it. Private data has always been valuable but we need something beyond the existing centralized web2 architecture for users to be fairly compensated for it.

## The Developer Experience 
The push towards full-speed web3 dApps lacks one missing piece: a development framework for building rich web3 dApps. A big reason that web3 has not yet become a reality yet is this lack of a framework. The TEA Project wants to make it easier for developers to make the jump to web3 by using our familiar development framework as their entry point.

*Only 1.5% of developers commonly use Solidity, a specialized language for Ethereum smart contracts according to a [Stack Overflow dev survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof)*

The TEA Project will have an SDK available to help shorten development time on our platform. Creating dApps for the TEA Project will always be straightforward for developers as our native binary format is WebAssembly (WASM). WASM, the native language of TApps, is fast, secure, and easy to output to from a variety of different programming languages. This flexibility makes it easier for developers to take the leap into web3 by using the TEA Project as their entry point.

The TEA framework makes building such dApps straightforward as it provides an SDK, wide programming language compatibility through WebAssembly, and code hosting through TEA's decentralized compute nodes. The TEA Project platform also handles billing and allows developers to deploy their code as microservices. These microservices are like libraries that other developers can call as part of their larger programs. The difference here is that the microservice authors get paid everytime their code is called from another developer's code.

As an infrastructure provider for web3, the TEA Project isn't itself a developer of web3 dApps. We'll make available reference TApps along with tutorials to help others build on TEA, but the work of actually producing viable web3 dApps will be up to the developers themselves. It's an open question which apps will make the successful transition from web2 to web3. It's not the TEA Project's role to pick the winners here. There will be a natural organic movement of certain classes of apps away from centralized hosting that require better data privacy and decentralization. The TEA Project's job is to ensure that our platform is the easiest to build on and lives up to the promise of full-speed decentralization when developers come looking for the ideal platform to deploy their dApps on.

There are many benefits for developers to use the TEA Project platform as a transition point to web3. One of the primary 3-tier architecture that has a front-end, an execution tier, and a database available for app developers.

1. Front-end (e.g. written in html, css, and javascript) that's hosted on IPFS.
2. An execution layer that replicates the computer power of the server. This execution tier is decentralized among the mining nodes running on our compute layer.
3. A database tier that allows developers to query the current state of their app. This functionality of TEA is also run on our compute nodes and is made possible by their on-board GPS module that orders state changes using time as the root of trust.

Code runs as WASM binaries, which allows developers to use their preferred programming language. When a client requests app execution, encrypted data (either local or hosted on IPFS) and encrypted binary code (hosted on IPFS) are decrypted within the TPM-protected enclaves of TEA's decentralized compute nodes. No trust is needed between developers, the hosting nodes, or the end user. The TEA Project ensures the developers and hosting nodes are paid through a transaction and the user gets the desired result from the app.

It's important to us that developers can build on the TEA Project without having to be experts in blockchain / decentralized design or having to learn a new language. Everything in the TEA Project is designed to look from the app's point of view like it's running on a normal cloud computing architecture, with the magical benefit that it's running fully decentralized. The TEA Project design handles these details so developers and decentralized app users don't have to think about them.

### Developers Funding 
Developers can use TEA Project’s built-in bonding curve to generate investment in their TApp. This funding mechanism allows TApps to leverage expected future revenue into early development funding. The TAppStore is where the entire TEA ecosystem meets: developers to publish their TApps, curators to publicize and invest in new trending TApps, and consumers to spend their TEA tokens on useful TApps they want to use.

<a id="item-seven"></a>
## TEA Project Ecosystem
The TEA Project ecosystem's main demographic groups are miners, developers, and consumers who each play a part in maintaining a healthy decentralized computing platform. A strong mining community must be developed to provide the infrastructure before developers are onboarded. Similarly, developers must develop compelling apps before consumers can be enticed to enter the ecosystem. 
Each demographic will be encouraged to enter the TEA Project through a variety of methods. 

### 1. Miners 
The TEA Project aims to build a healthy ecosystem from the ground up through miners who provide the hosting nodes. 

- Miners "plant" CML into their mining hardware equipped with an HSM and a GPS module and "harvest" TEA tokens. 
- Mining machines host web3 applications and are rewarded in TEA tokens based on the app's consumed computing resources.

### 2. Developers 
Miners are necessary for the actual computing infrastructure just as developers are necessary for building usable apps on top of that infrastructure. This segment of the rollout will include tech education & outreach on how to build on the TEA ecosystem. 

- Hackathon events and grant program released. 
- TEA SDK available helping developers build with the TEA dev framework. 
- TAppStore launched showcasing rich dApps running on the TEA platform. 

### 3. Consumers 
Consumers form the demand that rewards both the miners who provide the hosting nodes and the developers who create the TApps. We hope to see a positive feedback loop: as more consumers enter the ecosystem, developers can focus on making TApps that meet consumer demand.
Additionally, consumers can invest in each TApp through its bonding curve and promote the TApp on social media. Becoming a curator for a burgeoning TApp helps the consumer invest in the TApps that they use. The TApp tokens they hold will increase in price along the bonding curve as more buyers push the supply higher. And as consumer interest in TApps increase, they'll be incentivized to exchange ETH for TEA which in turn will support the TEA token price and grow the TEA economy.

## Competition
The emerging web3 strategies for solving data privacy issues have been fraught with compromises.

- Multiple projects have adopted Intel's SGX chip specification to provide a trusted execution environment (TEE) within the CPU itself. However, Intel is a central authority which introduces centralization, the hazards of which were realized when Intel decided to discontinue their SGX chip line for consumer CPUs.
- Other projects have chosen to leave everything encrypted within their platform to preserve data privacy. This type of design requires datacenter-level hardware to decrypt these data streams in a timely manner, which makes running a node an institutional endeavor outside the reach of ordinary miners. 
- The limitations of smart contract-based web3 platforms is often counteracted by introducing centralized hosting to do the heavy lifting for the dApp. For a gaming dApp, this could mean that while game items are tracked on the blockchain the actual gameplay happens on centralized servers. This of course turns supposed dApps into hybrid dApps with all of the data security issues that are typical with centralized hosting.

Smart contracts run slowly because of the consensus required to confirm transactions on the blockchain. Because Ethereum's mining nodes are not trustable (e.g. any of them could present an alternate ledger it hopes to pass off as the truth), a BFT consensus algorithm is necessary to deal with scenarios where not all nodes are telling the truth. The TEA Project is able to sidestep this quandary of decentralized nodes by performing remote attestation on all of its compute layer nodes. And we no longer have to worry about Byzantine faults because all of TEA’s compute nodes are trustable as determined by remote attestation. 

Typically, only centralized cloud computing can take consensus for granted as a single company is able to oversee all of the computing nodes. That allows cloud computing companies to be scalable and secure (as long as you trust the company). But we can’t totally trust our data with these companies as they are centralized and are typically not transparent with their data safeguards.

The TEA Project's non-traditional consensus uses time to ensure that transactions are properly ordered in our state machine. Proof of time gives TEA a consensus on the sequence of events between all decentralized nodes, which allows them to share a global state machine. The hardware security modules onboard the compute nodes ensures that the GPS units haven't been hacked or altered in anyway which ensures that the timestamps coming from each node are trustable. Because of our non-traditional consensus, our compute layer doesn't have any "TPS" (txns per second) limitations as it's not burdened with the slow BFT consensus that operates on blockchain.

It should be noted that the primary function of the smart contract is to keep the trust status of TEA's compute nodes. The smart contract also provides a list of IP addresses from which end-users can load the TAppStore. And although TEA Project is currently deployed to Ethereum, it can be deployed as a smart contract to multiple layer-1 blockchains.
