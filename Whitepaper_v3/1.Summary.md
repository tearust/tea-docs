TEA Project: Advancing Web3 Towards Full, Decentralized Compute
The TEA Project provides a platform where rich applications can run at native speeds across a decentralized network of computing nodes. The TEA Project builds on many emerging projects and paradigms which in and of themselves are not sufficient to solve the Blockchain Trilemma. Blockchains like Ethereum provide a world computer where smart contracts can run in a decentralized manner. But smart contracts by themselves cannot currently run complex algorithms such as those required by existing cloud-based applications. 
TEA’s layer-2 solution uses Ethereum as its layer-1 blockchain to run consensus on its layer-2 nodes through recording trust data from the onboard trusted platform modules (TPM). TEA’s layer-2 can then run dApps at full speed on nodes that have been confirmed as trustable by the layer-1 blockchain. We use time as reported by the nodes’ GPS to order transactions on our layer-2 state machine. The layer-2 state runs a separate consensus mechanism from the underlying blockchain it runs on top of. By combining blockchain with IPFS and trusted hardware (TPM and GPS modules), the TEA Project can meet the needs of large-scale, high-frequency apps while ensuring permission-less decentralization and privacy protection.
How TEA Project Solves Web2 & Web3’s Biggest Problems
TEA & Web2
The web2 world of cloud-hosted apps presents two differing problems both based on private user data.

From the end-user’s perspective, how can they gain access to useful apps without giving company’s access to their private data?
From the business’s perspective, is there an economic model that allows apps to be deployed without owning the servers such that they still get paid?

End-users who interact with apps on the TEA Project can feel secure that their data is safe as each node's trustability is vouchsafed by the platform itself. The technologies built into the TEA platform protects the data as well as the integrity of the result. Under the watchful eye of TPM security, the decentralized app’s computation is based on the expected code and the expected data. No one can alter the input code, the input data, or the output result. The result of the computation is correct given the computing environment is verified through proof of trust data that is shared in the network and verified via remote attestation. 
One of the major benefits of using apps deployed on the TEA Project is that computing only happens within the protected enclaves of the decentralized TEA Project nodes. This means that the node hosting the app code and private user data has no access while the app executes with the user-provided data. After the app execution is completed, the contents of the enclave is destroyed. The end-user gets the result from the app and there are no traces of their private data left anywhere on our network. There's no chance of data breaches during the entire process.
And from the business’s perspective, the TEA Project allows app developers to get paid even though they no longer own the servers that their app runs on. And although they’re no longer able to monetize user data because of the encrypted enclaves of the TEA nodes, we look forward to the day when data privacy is the accepted norm when interacting with the cloud apps of the future.

TEA & Web3
Blockchains like Ethereum provide a world computer where smart contracts can run in a decentralized manner. They are further augmented by Web3 innovations like IPFS, a peer-2-peer file system that stores files decentralized. But smart contracts by themselves cannot currently run complex algorithms. Attempts to do so have shown smart contracts to be too slow or too expensive as they lack the processing power compared to modern cloud computers. A layer-2 solution would be needed to offload the computation tasks as long as it could provide a similar trust level as the layer-1 blockchain.
The emerging web3 strategies for solving data privacy issues have been fraught with compromises.
Multiple projects have adopted Intel's SGX chip specification to provide a trusted execution environment (TEE) within the CPU itself. However, Intel is a central authority which introduces centralization, the hazards of which were realized when Intel decided to discontinue their SGX chip line for consumer CPUs.
Other projects have chosen to leave everything encrypted within their platform to preserve data privacy. This type of design requires datacenter-level hardware to decrypt these data streams in a timely manner, which makes running a node an institutional endeavor outside the reach of ordinary miners. 
The limitations of smart contract-based web3 platforms is often counteracted by introducing centralized hosting to do the heavy lifting for the dApp. For a gaming dApp, this could mean that while game items are tracked on the blockchain the actual gameplay happens on centralized servers. This of course turns supposed dApps into hybrid dApps with all of the data security issues that are typical with centralized hosting.
Smart contracts run slow because of the consensus required to confirm transactions on the blockchain. The TEA Project is able to sidestep this quandary by keeping its blockchain-based consensus layer separate from its compute layer. And because all of TEA’s layer-2 nodes are trustable (as determined by the layer-1 consensus), we no longer have to worry about Byzantine faults on layer-2. 
Typically, only centralized cloud computing can take consensus for granted as a single company is able to oversee all of the computing nodes. That allows cloud computing companies to be scalable and secure (as long as you trust the company). But we can’t totally trust our data with these companies as they are centralized and are typically not transparent with their data safeguards.
The TEA Project solves scalability by using non-BFT consensus to run TApps on its fast layer-2.
The TEA Project uses its layer-1 blockchain to run BFT to filter out all non-trustable nodes.
TEA’s layer-2 can check the trust status of any of its nodes by querying the layer-1 blockchain. The TEA Project's layer-2 can now use a much faster non-BFT consensus because it can assume all of its nodes are trustable as reported by the layer-1 blockchain.

The TEA Project's layer-2 non-traditional consensus uses time to ensure that transactions are always properly ordered in our state machine. Because of this two-layer design, our second compute layer can have potentially limitless TPS as it's not burdened with the slow BFT consensus that operates on our layer-1 (Ethereum) blockchain.
The TEA Project is a layer-2 architecture that allows dApps that are the equivalent of their cloud computing counterparts to run on the blockchain. Our solution allows fully-featured applications to run on top of blockchains and isn't limited to only smart contracts. These are similar to what's now running on centralized cloud hosting, except they'll be decentralized by virtue of running in the TEA Project ecosystem.
• TEA Project's layer-2 can be deployed as a smart contract to multiple layer-1 blockchains. Besides providing a list of IP addresses for the TAppStore, the primary function of the smart contract is to keep the trust data of TEA's layer-2 nodes.
An important distinction with other layer-2s is that TEA doesn't roll-up its layer-2 transactions to be confirmed by the underlying layer-1. The layer-1 that TEA runs its layer-2 on top of are separate layers and have separate consensus mechanisms. Whereas the layer-1 relies solely on blockchain as its root of trust, the TEA Project also adds trusted hardware and time to form its non-traditional consensus.
TEA Project Summary
The TEA Project has many complexities so it may be helpful to the reader if we summarize what we’ve already covered.

The TEA Project is an infrastructure provider for the emerging world of web3. As we move away from the centralized server stack and the user data abuses that are endemic to the hosted cloud, the TEA Project provides a decentralized compute infrastructure	that respects private user data.
But a decentralized compute network like TEA’s introduces the question of trust. If anyone can run a node that hosts apps, how can we trust these nodes?
The TEA Project creates a decentralized compute network capable of running full speed apps by combining three roots of trust:
1. Blockchain consensus (using the Ethereum blockchain) is done on the remote attestation results of TEA’s layer-2 nodes.
2. TEA uses the hardware security modules (such as TPM chips) aboard the layer-2 nodes to run compute tasks privately. A natural byproduct of this architecture is that user data remains private and isn’t leaked outside the enclave.
3. Proof of time is used to reliably order transactions from the decentralized nodes. This forms the basis of the state machine that maintains the present status of all the apps running on TEA’s layer-2.

TEA’s Biggest Innovation is Trust
In the TEA Project, computing nodes become trusted through a remote attestation process. The concept of trusted computing has so far been stuck in the limiting paradigm of one-computer = one-metal-box. This old thinking limits its expansion and possible uses cases in a distributed world. It needs the help of blockchain and other emerging technologies to expand beyond its current barriers. In particular, it needs a solution like the TEA Project to make a decentralized network of hosting nodes trustable without sacrificing app execution speed.
In the TEA Project, trust is already taken care of by our layer-1 blockchain. That allows our layer-2 nodes to all trust each other by default and no longer need to watch for Byzantine faults. Every TEA node can reference this PoT data for every node participant to verify any individual TEA node's integrity through a remote attestation process completed through smart contracts. Nodes in the TEA network are incentivized by the token economy to perform remote attestation verification.
The TEA nodes’ hardware security modules allow the compute nodes to offer a hardware-protected enclave where code and data can run securely. Anyone outside the TEA module's hardware has no knowledge about what happens inside the module. Neither the TEA node's owner nor the server connected to the module will know, nor can anyone predict which node is running any particular task. This gives the TEA network security as no information can be breached during this secure workflow.
The TEA Project's goal is to build a platform that allows code and data to run inside trusted TEA modules without needing to trust anything else. The technologies built into the TEA platform protects the data and the integrity of the result.
The decentralized app’s computation is based on the expected code and the expected data. No one can alter the input code, the input data, or the output result. The result of the computation is correct given the computing environment is verified through proof of trust data that is shared in the network and verified via remote attestation. The TEA Project’s decentralized apps can thus run as fast as cloud computers and do so with a an even higher level of trust.
