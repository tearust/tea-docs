# Decentralization movement - Internet is broken, we are trying to fix it!

From [Zoë Corbyn](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zoe-corbyn)'s 2018 article [Decentralisation: the next big step for the world wide web](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/08/decentralisation-next-big-step-for-the-world-wide-web-dweb-data-internet-censorship-brewster-kahle), 
>"The proponents of the so-called decentralised web – or DWeb – want a new, better web where the entire planet’s population can communicate without having to rely on big companies that amass our data for profit and make it easier for governments to conduct surveillance. "

and 


>"The DWeb, say proponents, is about giving people a choice: the same services, but decentralised and not creepy. It promises control and privacy, and things can’t all of a sudden disappear because someone decides they should."

If you did not understant what he said back in 2018, you probably totally understand it now. Our existing internet is broken, we are trying to fix it.

# The existing cures and remaining problems
There are so many new projects released the recent years. They fixed parts of the broken internet. Such as:
- IPFS provides a peer-2-peer file system which a store files in decentralzied manner.
- Blockchain, especially Blockchain 2.0 (since ETH), provides a world computer that smart contracts can run in decentralized manner.
- Trusted computing lets us to trust an originally untrusted node to access sensitive information by doing remote attestation.
- WebAssembly expend beyond the boundary of web browsers. It can run on servers under a securely designed runtime.

Each of them fixed a specific problem, and made a huge improvement towards a full featured dApp platform. However, each of them also contains unsolved problems blocking dApp becoming practical.
- File System is a necessary pre-condition to build a world computer above, but not enough. Code is just a common type of data if not executed in CPU.
- Smart contracts nowaday cannot run complex algorithm. It is either super slow or expensive. Still far from what we can do today with cloud computing. A layer-2 solution needs to offload the computation tasks as long as they can provide similar trust level as blockchain does.
- Trusted computing have been around for so many years, but the boundary of single metal box limited its expending. It needs to extend with blockchain and other new technologies and beyond.
- WebAssembly is still at its early stage. It needs practical use cases to get popular.
